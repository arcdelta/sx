> Micro CLI for interactive running npm & yarn scripts.

## Gosh, why?

First, I wanted to practise creating public CLI packages/libraries.

Secondly, I'm lazy. Like, *really lazy*. I don't even like to type much. And sometimes I'm perplexed
by amount of steps required to run an npm or yarn script. Especially if you can't remember what
scripts a project even has without diving into an IDE or `cat`ing (`less`ing, `bat`ing) a
`package.json`.

Thirdly, if you seek for autocompletion, I would suggest you to use [this zsh enhancement](https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-better-npm-completion).
If you are like meâ€”read on.

## Installation

> Node v12.18.0 or higher is required

```bash
$ npm i -g @arcdelta/sx
```

## Usage

### Basic

Just type at the root of your project:

```bash
$ sx
```

This will run an interactive prompt with scripts from `package.json` as selectable options.
You pick one, hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> and that's it.

I have plans on adding [lerna support](https://github.com/arcdelta/sx/issues/2) and
[picking multiple scripts](https://github.com/arcdelta/sx/issues/9).

### Options

| Option            | Description                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `-n`, `--npm`     | Use **npm** to run a script.         |
| `-p`, `--pnpm`    | Use **pnpm** to run a script.        |
| `-y`, `--yarn`    | Use **yarn** to run a script.        |
| `-v`, `--version` | Output the current version.          |
| `-h`, `--help`    | Output help message.                 |

### Package manager

If you use **yarn** instead of **npm**, you can instruct `sx` to use it as a
default package manager by exposing a `SX_PM=yarn` environment variable in your
shell's rc file (`.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`, etc).
